### Who am I?

I'm Bruno Brant, a brazilian *software engineer* and *architect*, with 15+ years of practice in developing complex systems. I'm currently based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil's largest capital. My current professional interests are algorithms and optimization, language development, microservices architecture and AI. When I'm not developing software, I'm usually playing games or reading. 

I created this blogs as both a way to share some of my thoughts and also to do some brain storming. We better organize our mind when we write about things.
