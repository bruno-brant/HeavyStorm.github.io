This is my third or fourth attempt to create a blog, and I do hope that I succeed in keeping it up-to-date. At least now I finally have the time I need to create new posts, and keep it going. Also, I *love* GitHub pages. It's much nicer to be in a platform that I (kinda) control. 

As in my previous attempts, this blog will be focused on software development, but this time I might post some other things that aren't directly related to it. Stay tuned for updates!
