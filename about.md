### Who am I?

I'm Bruno Brant, a brazilian *software engineer* and *architect*, with 15+ years of practice in developing complex systems. I'm currently based in São Paulo, Brazil's largest capital. My current professional interests are algorithms and optimization, language development, microservices architecture and AI. When I'm not developing software, I'm usually playing games or reading. 

I created this blogs as both a way to share some of my thoughts and also to do some brain storming. We better organize our mind when we write about things.
