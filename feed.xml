     &lt;p&gt;After some effort, I managed to allow my blog to become multilingual. Now all posts are in Portuguese or English. Avid readers (as if I had any!) will have noticed the icons that allow you to select the language:&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;p&gt;You probably know that sometimes (&lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; times), a developer’s job is much more research or analysis than programming!

     &lt;p&gt;This is my third or fourth attempt to create a blog, and I do hope that I succeed in keeping it up-to-date. At least now I finally have the time I need to create new posts, and keep it going. Also, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; GitHub pages. It’s much nicer to be in a platform that I (kinda) control.&lt;/p&gt;
